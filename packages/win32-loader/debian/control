Description: Debian-Installer loader for win32
 This package provides a win32 program that can be used as a loader for
 Debian Installer, acting as a more user-friendly boot mechanism than
 traditional BIOS-based boot.
 .
 This package contains the cdrom/usb-disk add-on that starts a media-based
 install.
